Description: # PynamiX
        
        [Documentation here](https://pages.github.sydney.edu.au/scigem/pynamix/build/html/index.html)
        
        ## Installation
        Work in progress. Hopefully via `pip install pynamix` but YMMV.
        
        ## Examples
        Try out the included Jupyter notebook to see how to use the package.
        
        ## Dependencies
        Work in progress - should be handled in pip install. Currently requires:
        ```
        python3
        matplotlib
        numpy
        ```
        
        ## Deploying to PyPI
        Run the following to make a new distribution and upload it to PyPI
        ```
        python3 setup.py sdist
        twine upload dist/*
        ```
        
        ## Documentation
        
        We use `sphinx` to manage the docs. Update documentation with:
        ```
        cd docs
        make html
        ```
        Once these are built, you can commit and push the changes to github to have them refreshed on github pages.
